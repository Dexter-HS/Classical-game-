## **1\. Project Title**

**Snake Water Gun Game**

## **2\. Overview of the project**

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic childhood game "Snake, Water, Gun." It is a variation of the popular "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The program allows a user to play a single round against the computer. The computer selects its move randomly, ensuring a fair game, while the user inputs their choice via the command line. The logic determines the winner based on standard rules:

* **Snake** drinks **Water** (Snake wins)  
* **Water** douses **Gun** (Water wins)  
* **Gun** shoots **Snake** (Gun wins)

## **3\. Features**

* **Player vs Computer:** Play a 1-on-1 match against an AI opponent.  
* **Randomized AI:** The computer uses Python's random module to make unpredictable moves.  
* **Instant Feedback:** Immediately see what the computer chose and the result of the match (Win, Lose, or Draw).  
* **Simple Input:** Easy-to-use text input system ('s', 'w', or 'g').

## **4\. Technologies/tools used**

* **Language:** Python 3  
* **Libraries:** random (Standard Python library for generating random choices)

## **5\. Steps to install & run the project**
